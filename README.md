# Diabetes Prediction
### This is a web-app using flask and streamlit  for predicting diabetes.
#### 1.First data is analyzed on diabetest datatset and predcition is shown using Logistic Regression github repo link is here - https://github.com/ritwick-1234/predict_using_logistic_regression   .  
### In this logistic Regression model accuracy is coming out to be 77%.
### Using decision tree model highest accuracy is coming out to be 78% after tuning hyperparameter. Github repo link is here for decision tree hyperparameter https://github.com/ritwick-1234/prediction_using_decission_tree
### Using Random Forest highest accuracy is coming out to be 77%  tuning hyperparameters of Random forest . Repo link for random forest  - https://github.com/ritwick-1234/random
### Using SVM algorithm on diabetes dataset highest accuracy 88.9% .Github repo link for SVM   -  https://github.com/ritwick-1234/svc_diabetes_predictor
### Using K-Means algorithm on diabetes dataset highest accuracy is coming out to be only 15% .Github repo link is there for K-Means  -  https://github.com/ritwick-1234/k_means_diabetes_prediction_1
## After applying all the algorithms SVM is chosen for giving highest accuracy .
